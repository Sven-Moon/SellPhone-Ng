# SellphoneNg

This project was my very first Angular app. It allows the user to input the different phones they have to sell and then compiles a sales order form with the total. There's no method for changing the available phones or prices and I kept payment out of it completely. <br>I chose a white/grey/black theme since it's so hard to mess that up, though it comes out to be visually bland. I was learning a lot about how to control space with css properties, largely using vw & vh when other properties probably would have netted a better outcome in many places. <br>Mostly, this was just an introduction to how to make things work, and it did that just fine.
